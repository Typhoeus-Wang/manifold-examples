# manifold-examples
Study of the dependence of  manifold learning algorithms on parameters 

Next meeting: Monday 6/20 2:30pm 

Plan for week 1
* learn scikit-learn manifold learning functions, specifically isomap, spectral_embedding, lle, [t-sne], [ltsa if available]
* learn megaman package by MMP
* learn t-sne (this is part of scikit-learn)
* learn UMAP
* write code that generates synthetic examples

Plan for week 2
* share with others what you have learned/done
* learn basics of manifold learning -- short tutorial by MMP
* plan and run first set of experiments
